# Python programming practice on HackerRank

Started this exercise on 15th July 2020, after a refresher of Python fundamentals with [Udacity's Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110) and [Kaggle's Learn Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python).

I will be doing this everyday (until this question bank lasts) to get comfortable with Python programming. I am also making notes to re-visit important tid-bits and ingrain the use of Python built-ins/libraries/efficient data structures.

This repo's directory structure reflects Python code seperated by questions attempted each day. [questions.md](questions.md) contains the list of problem statements from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python).
