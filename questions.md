# Problem statements from HackerRank Python practice

The topic of these bullet items reflect the title of each problem from HackerRank. What follows is a summary of the problem description.

1. List Comprehensions  
You are given three integers ```x```, ```y``` and ```z``` and representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer ```n```.
Print a list of all possible coordinates given by ```(i, j, k)``` on a 3D grid where the sum of ```i + j + k``` is not equal to ```n```.

2. Find the Runner-Up Score!  
Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score.
You are given ```n``` scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

3. Nested Lists  
Given the names and grades for each student in a class of ```N``` students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

4. Finding the percentage  
Input a dictionary of student names and list of marks.
Output the average of these marks obtained by a particular student correct to 2 decimal places.

5. Lists  
Consider a list. You can perform the following functions:
insert i e: Insert integer ```e``` at position ```i```
print: Print the list
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer ```e```
append e: Insert integer ```e``` at the end of the list
sort: Sort the list
pop: Pop the last element from the list
reverse: Reverse the list
Initialize your list and read in the value of ```n``` followed by lines of ```n``` commands where each command will be of the types listed above.
Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

6. Tuples  
Given an integer ```n``` and ```n``` space-separated integers as input, create a tuple ```t``` of those integers. Then compute and print the result of ```hash(t)```

7. Zipped!  
The National University conducts an examination of ```N``` students in ```X``` subjects.
Your task is to compute the average scores of each student.

8. Input()  
You are given a polynomial of a single indeterminate (or variable), ```x```.
You are also given the values of ```x``` and ```k```. Your task is to verify if ```P(x) == k```.

9. Python Evaluation  
You are given an expression in a line. Read that line as a string variable, such as var, and print the result using eval(var).

10. Athlete Sort  
You are given a spreadsheet that contains a list of ```N``` athletes and their details (such as age, height, weight and so on).
You are required to sort the data based on the ```K```th attribute and print the final resulting table.

11. Any or All  
Input a list of ```N``` integers. Check if they are all positive palindromic integers.

12. ginortS  
Input a string and sort it in the following manner:
All sorted lowercase letters are ahead of uppercase letters.
All sorted uppercase letters are ahead of digits.
All sorted odd digits are ahead of sorted even digits.
